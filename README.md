# PracticePython

WHAT IT IS? :

There are 36 exercises for python learners to practice in http://www.practicepython.org/.
This repo contains my solutions for these exercises. 
              
FOR WHOM? : 

These are pretty beginner level practice. 
I recommend them to someone who just starting to get to know the beautiful python.

PREREQUISITES? :

Yes, basic understanding of variable assignment, loops (while & for), conditions (if-else), basic web-scrapping (request                  & beautifulsoup), function would be necessary. 

HOW TO START? : 

Since these are for begginers, I must say, after knpowing some basics of the language, jumping to solve some begginer                     level problems independently can be a good direction to learn. Getting stuck is common, so learning to find a way to                       overcome it with the help of internet, forums or blogs are also crucial. Anyway, These 36 exercise can be a good start.                   Try solving them by yourself first.
